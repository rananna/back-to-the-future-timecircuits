> **Great Scott!** You've found the schematics for a fully-functional, WiFi-enabled Time Circuits display. While it can't *actually* travel through time (the flux capacitor technology is still a bit tricky), it brings the iconic look, feel, and sounds of the DeLorean's dashboard right to your desk. Using an ESP32, 12 alphanumeric displays, and a little bit of 1.21-gigawatt... I mean, 5-volt... ingenuity, this display connects to your network to show the Destination Time, Present Time, and Last Time Departed, all fully configurable from a slick, mobile-friendly web interface.

## Time Circuit Schematics (Wiring)

This project uses two separate I2C buses to manage all 12 displays. This simplifies wiring but requires careful attention to the I2C addresses.
